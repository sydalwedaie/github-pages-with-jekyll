That’s it. I’m in. The corona pandemic has grounded me for 45 days. I always wanted to start a coding bootcamp,  but my flying job was in the way. This situation might be a blessing in disguise, so I took a leap of faith and registered for Hack Reactor’s Premium Prep course. It’s due to start in a week, on May 11th 2020.

Interestingly enough, even their prep course needs some pre-work! I have already ticked one of them, Eloquent JS 1-4, way back in 2016. I reviewed it again some time later, and I’m reviewing it yet again for the third time I guess! The other pre-requisite was the preliminary course on watchandcode.io. It was about building a simple todo app which I managed to complete in two days.

Needless to say, I’m not a total beginner in this field. Ever since 2012 I started seriously learning HTML and CSS, followed by multiple episodes of JavaScript sprints every now and then. I’ve built multiple websites, finished way to many courses from Lynda, Codecademy, Udacity, Code School, and an in-person 5-day course on HTML5 for mobile. I can’t say which of them had the greatest effect, but I ended up pretty confident about the very basics of programmings, and developed the ability to quickly recall forgotten concepts and learn new ones.

So there I am, taking advantage of the break to finally hone my coding skills to mastery.
